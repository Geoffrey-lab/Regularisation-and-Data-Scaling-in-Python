# Regularisation-and-Data-Scaling-in-Python
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides a detailed guide on regularisation and data scaling techniques in Python. The notebook explores the importance of data scaling and demonstrates how to implement both standardisation and min-max normalisation using a real-world dataset.
