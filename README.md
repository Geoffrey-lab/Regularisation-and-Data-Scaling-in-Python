# Regularisation and Data Scaling in Python

## Description

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides a detailed guide on regularisation and data scaling techniques in Python. The notebook explores the importance of data scaling and demonstrates how to implement both standardisation and min-max normalisation using a real-world dataset.

## Notebook Contents

### 1. Introduction to Data Scaling
- **Scaling Importance**: Discusses the necessity of scaling in machine learning and its impact on model performance.
- **Types of Scaling**: Explains normalisation and standardisation, their formulas, and the scenarios where each is beneficial.

### 2. Normalisation
- **Formula**: \( \hat{x}_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij} - \min(x_j)}{\max(x_j) - \min(x_j)} \)
- **Advantages**: Useful for algorithms that assume a bounded input range.
- **Disadvantages**: Sensitive to outliers which can compress the bulk of the data into a small range.

### 3. Standardisation
- **Formula**: \( \hat{x}_{ij} = \frac{x_{ij} - \mu_j}{\sigma_j} \)
- **Advantages**: Centres data around zero with a standard deviation of one.
- **Disadvantages**: Does not bound data within a fixed range, which can include negative values.

### 4. Data Preparation
- **Loading Data**: Uses a dataset related to environmental metrics and biodiversity from an online source.
- **Initial Exploration**: Examines the first few rows and the shape of the dataset to understand its structure.

### 5. Implementing Standardisation
- **Splitting Data**: Separates predictors and response variables.
- **Scaling Process**: Applies `StandardScaler` from `sklearn` to standardise the predictors.
- **Result Analysis**: Evaluates the scaled data and visualises the distribution of one example variable.

### 6. Implementing Min-Max Normalisation
- **Scaling Process**: Applies `MinMaxScaler` from `sklearn` to normalise the predictors.
- **Result Analysis**: Evaluates the normalised data and visualises the distribution of one example variable.

## Example Data
- **Dataset**: Environmental and biodiversity metrics dataset.
- **Variables**: Includes metrics like WaterQualityIndex, ClimateChangeImpactScore, ConservationFunding, etc.
- **Exploration**: Demonstrates the difference in scales among various variables.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage
To use this notebook, clone the repository and run the Jupyter Notebook:

```sh

## Conclusion
This repository provides a practical guide to understanding and implementing data scaling techniques. The notebook serves as a valuable resource for data scientists and machine learning practitioners aiming to preprocess their data effectively to enhance model performance.
